## Description

The goal of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. JavaScript date library was used to format timestamps.

User seeds are provide to get the application up and running quickly.
